I'm a first year PhD student at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests include causal inference, Bayesian methods, image analysis and their applications in public health and medical research. This summer, I will be joining [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) as a Google Summer of Code student where I will be implementing a submodule for Dirichlet processes. I also enjoy coding, playing sports and eating [fruit yogurt](https://www.activia.ca/en/activia-fruits/peach/). Feel free to connect with me!
